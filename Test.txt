// Manual Testing
// Automated Testing
// Manual Testing is one of the ways but in modern developement we can write programs/code which performs the test on specific modules or units or even entire application
// Testing is really essential and also React also supports it well with the use of libraries
// As a good react developer you must be aware and capable of writing/managing automated Testing


//three main categories of automated testing : - unit test, Integrated test , End-to-End
// Unit testing is all about checking individual functions, components or basically units of code
// Integrated test: - This type of test comes in picture when code pieces, units or components are integrated and together how do they work
// End to End: - This type of test is to check the entire application and its flow
// There are many ways or robots to automate data entry process and generating reports for success and failure status
// Jest and Enzyme are the libararies which are very popular and is often used with react while testing automation
// Generally both jest and enzyme libararies are used together , jest is availaible with tools like assertion, mocking, test runner
// Enyme gives more functionality while dealing with components or basically the UI

// The correct way to name the test files is, Component name- Product.js 
// Test File - Product.test.js
// To run the test npm run test
// The meaning of test Driven developement: - if you have a product component to do then the component testing is written first with all the validations
// Then you keep on building the component product and it will keep on checking the test
